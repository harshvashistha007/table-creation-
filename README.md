📘 harsh.py
📝 Description

This Python script demonstrates basic programming concepts such as:

Conditional statements (if, elif)

List iteration using for loops

Basic arithmetic operations and loops

It appears to be a practice file for learning Python fundamentals like grading logic, looping through lists, and multiplication tables.

📂 File Structure
harsh.py

Main Components

Grading System (Commented Out)
Takes user input for marks and prints a grade:

marks = int(input("enter your marks"))
if marks >= 90:
    print("your grade is A+")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("your grade is A")


(Currently commented out — you can uncomment it to use.)

Student List Loop (Commented Out)
Iterates through a list of student names:

student = ["Asdf", "sffffffd", "DEEE", "gashgv"]
for i in student:
    print(i)


Multiplication Logic (Active Code)
Prints multiples of a number (5 in this case):

a = 5
for i in range(1, 11):
    i = i * a
    print(i)

▶️ How to Run

🔧 Possible Improvements

Fix small typo in “grqade” → “grade”

Add user input for a to make the multiplication dynamic
